# Direction to add a commit

1. Check the current git branch using the git branch command, `git branch --show-current`.
2. Only if the current is the `main` branch, check out a new branch with a short semantic name taking the changes into consideration.
3. Check the changes and stage them if there are not staged.
4. Create a commit message depending on the content of the change with an appropriate emoji listed in the [gitmoji.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/gitmoji.mdc) as a prefix of the commit message
5. Add a commit with the created message
6. Push to the remote repository
