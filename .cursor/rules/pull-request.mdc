# Direction to create an pull request

1. Check the current git branch using the git branch command, `git branch --show-current`.
2. If the current branch is `main`, check out a new branch with a short semantic name.
3. Check the diff between `main` branch and the current branch.
4. If there are any changes which are not staged, staged all of them.
5. If there are staged changes, add a commit of the staged changes with an appropriate commit message referring to [commit.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/commit.mdc)
6. Push the commit to the remote repository.
7. Create a pull request to the `main` branch from the current branch if it does not exist.
8. Assign the user who created this pull request as an assignee.
