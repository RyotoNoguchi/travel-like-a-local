# Direction to create an pull request

1. Check the current git branch using the git branch command, `git branch --show-current`.
2. If the current branch is `main`, ask the user from which branch he/she wants to create a pull request and check out the branch based on the answer from the user.
3. Ask the user to provide the URL of the related GitHub issue if not have been provided yet.
4. Create a pull request from the current branch to the `main` branch with the properties below.
    - Title: the title of the related GitHub issue provided by the user
    - Body: create a pull request body referring to the commits based on the [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](mdc:.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) template
5.  Assign the user who created this pull request as an assignee of this pull request.
